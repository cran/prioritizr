\description{
Irreplaceability scores can be used to assess the relative importance
of planning units in a solution to a conservation planning
\code{\link[=problem]{problem()}}.
}
\details{
The following methods are available for calculating irreplaceability scores:

\describe{

\item{\code{\link[=replacement_cost]{replacement_cost()}}}{
The replacement cost scores (based
on Cabeza and Moilanen 2006) quantify the change in the objective
function (e.g. additional costs required to meet feature targets) of the
optimal solution if a given planning unit in a solution cannot be acquired.
They can (i) account for the cost of different planning units, (ii) account
for multiple management zones, (iii) apply to any objective function, and
(iv) identify truly irreplaceable planning units (denoted with infinite
values).}

\item{\code{\link[=ferrier_score]{ferrier_score()}}}{
The Ferrier scores (Ferrier \emph{et al.} 2000) quantify the importance of
planning units for meeting feature targets. They can only be applied to
conservation problems with a minimum set objective and a single zone (i.e.
the classic \emph{Marxan}-type problem). Furthermore---unlike the
replacement cost scores---the Ferrier irreplaceability scores provide a
score for each feature within each planning unit, providing insight into
why certain planning units are more important than other planning units.}

\item{\code{\link[=rarity_weighted_richness]{rarity_weighted_richness()}}}{
The rarity weighted richness scores (based on Williams \emph{et al.}
1996) are simply a measure of biological diversity. They do not account for
planning costs, multiple management zones, objective functions, or feature
targets (or weightings). They merely describe the spatial patterns of
biodiversity, and do not account for many of the factors needed to quantify
the importance of a planning unit for achieving conservation goals.}

}

Generally speaking, we recommend using replacement cost scores for small and
moderate sized problems (e.g. less than 30,000 planning units) when it is
feasible to do so. It can take a very long time to compute replacement
cost scores, and so it is simply not feasible to compute these scores for
particularly large problems. For moderate and large sized problems (e.g.
more than 30,000 planning units), we recommend using the Ferrier
irreplaceability scores if possible. As mentioned earlier, the Ferrier
irreplaceability scores can only be used for a specific type of conservation
problem. For large sized problems (e.g. more than 100,000 planning units),
we recommend using the rarity weighted richness scores simply because there
is no other choice available. It has been known for decades that such
static measures of biodiversity lead to poor conservation plans
(Kirkpatrick 1983).

# and extract the total irreplaceability scores

# calculate irreplaceability scores using rarity weighted richness scores
ir3 <- rarity_weighted_richness(p1, s1)

# plot irreplaceability scores
plot(stack(ir1, ir2, ir3), axes = FALSE, box = FALSE,
     main = c("replacement cost", "Ferrier score",
              "rarity weighted richness"))
