\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's
distribution that needs to be protected.
}
\details{
Please note that failing to specify targets will return a default
error message when solving.The exception is the maximum cover problem
(see \code{\link{add_max_cover_objective}}), which maximizes all features
in the solution and therefore does not require targets.


The following list contains the targets can be added to a conservation
planning \code{\link{problem}}.

\describe{

  \item{\code{\link{add_relative_targets}}}{Set targets as a proportion
  (between 0 and 1) of the maximum level of representation of features in
  the study area.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_absolute_targets}}}{Set targets expressed as the
  actual value of features in the study area that need to be represented in
  the prioritization.}

  \item{\code{\link{add_loglinear_targets}}}{Set targets as a proportion
  (between 0 and 1) and calculated using a log-linear equation and four
  tuning parameters.}
