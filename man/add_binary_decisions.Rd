\description{
Add a binary decision to a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}}.
This is the classic decision of either prioritizing or not prioritizing a
planning unit. Typically, this decision has the assumed action of buying
the planning unit to include in a protected area network. If no decision is
added to a problem then this decision class will be used by default.
}
\details{
Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on planning units.
These decisions are then associated with actions (e.g. turning a planning
unit into a protected area). If no decision is explicitly added to a problem,
then the binary decision class will be used by default. Only a single
decision should be added to a \code{ConservationProblem} object. \strong{If
multiple decisions are added to a problem object, then the last one to be
added will be used.}
