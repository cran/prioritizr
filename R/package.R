#' prioritizr
#'
#' \emph{Prioritizr} is an R package for solving systematic conservation
#' planning problems. By using integer linear programming (ILP)
#' techniques, this package offers a flexible interface for creating
#' reserve selection problems that can be tailored to the specific needs of the
#' conservation planner (Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2000; Billionnet 2013).
#' Conservation problems can be solved using a variety of commercial and
#' open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms
#' conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as greedy
#' heuristics or simulated annealing, the exact algorithms used by
#' \emph{prioritizr} are guaranteed to find optimal solutions. This package
#' also has the functionality to read \href{http://marxan.net/}{Marxan} input
#' data (Ball \emph{et al.} 2009) and find much better solutions in a much
#' shorter period of time than Marxan  (Beyer \emph{et al.} 2016). See the
#' \href{https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr}{online code repository}
#' for more information.

#' package contains further example datasets and worked examples. The vignettes
#' in this package are listed below.
