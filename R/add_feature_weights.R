#' Conservation planning problems that aim to maximize the representation of
#' features may not be able to conserve all of them if the budget is not high
#' enough. In such budget-limited problems, it may be desirable to prefer the
#' representation of some features over other features. Weights can be
#' applied to a problem to favor the representation of some features over other
#' features when making decisions about how the budget should be allocated.
#'
#' @param x \code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.
#'
#' @param weights \code{numeric} weights. Features with higher weights indicate
#'   that it is more desirable to represent them in the solution. Weights
#'   cannot have negative values.
#'
#' @details Weights can only be applied to a budget-limited
#'   type of planning problem (i.e. \code{\link{add_max_cover_objective}},
#'   and \code{\link{add_max_features_objective}}. Weights can also
#'   be applied to problems that aim to maximize phylogenetic representation
#'   (\code{\link{add_max_phylo_objective}}) to favor the
#'   representation of specific features over the representation of
#'   some phylogenetic branches.
